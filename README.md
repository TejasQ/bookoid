## What can I contribute?

The [issues](https://github.com/TejasQ/bookoid/issues) page has a list of things we want to do and a bunch of discussions being had.

## Technologies

This project uses:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) (with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/))
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org/)

so far. We'd recommend familiarity with these before continuing. Read each one's docs if you haven't already and come back.

> Pro tip: use the [Tailwind IntelliSense VS Code plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) for a better developer experience.

## Learning

The best way to learn if you're unfamiliar with most things is to check out the [pull requests](https://github.com/TejasQ/bookoid/pulls) page to find "pull requests" for each feature. Pull requests are things that contain _modified code_ that _adds or removes_ functionality or behavior.

## Contributing

You need to be familiar with [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) if you aren't already. We recommend checking the docs.

If you're good with `git`, and have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed,

1. Clone this repo
1. `cd` into it and run `yarn` to install dependencies
1. `yarn dev` will start a local development server with fast refresh allowing you to develop locally
